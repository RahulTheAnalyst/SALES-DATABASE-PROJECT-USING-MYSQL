# Sales-Database-Project
Creating Database : 
In this Project I have created a sales database using MYSQL and used different commands to understands the insights of the database.
The sales database consists of 3 different tables like Sales, Employee and city.
The first table provides sales details of the company and it consist of columns city_id,product,Month1,Year1 & value1 and columns are given a suffix of number 1 because the names are functions which cannot be used as names.
Second table is the Employee table consist of emp_id,city_id,Emp_name,Month1,Year1 & manager_id.
Last table is the details of city where the products are doings sales.
The common column is city_id which is used as a primary key to link all the tables.
Using all thesew tables a sales database system was created in MYSQL.

Using Query :
To know the insights of the company I have used different queries and given below are the details of the query:
Query 1 :To Find top 2 highest selling product and their total value.
Query 2 :To Find city wise, month wise total sales in descending order of sales.
Query 3 :To Find employee wise total sales of each month and year excluding the manager.
Query 4 :To Find cities with no employees for given months.
Query 5 :To Find cities with no sales.
Query 6 :To find manager wise, city wise sales of each product for each month.
